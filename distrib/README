0. Before making a distribution
-------------------------------

- Run "make test".
- Create a tag vX.Y.Z where "X.Y.Z" is the version.


1. Making Unix distribution
---------------------------

Run "make -C distrib distrib_unix", the output file will be
bakefile-X.Y.Z-bin.tar.bz2.


2. Making Windows distribution
------------------------------

1. Install a recent version of Python 2.7 (last tested with 2.7.15) and
   make sure Python's Scripts directory (e.g. C:\Python27\Scripts) is in PATH.

2. Install PyInstaller v3.6 (latest version compatible with PyInstaller 2.7):

     $ pip2 install pyinstaller==3.6

3. Check that upx and zip are in PATH.

4. Run "make -C distrib distrib_win", the output file be bakefile-X.Y.Z-win.zip

Notice that at one time there was an effort to produce an MSI installer for
bakefile and its remains can be found in wix subdirectory, however the files
there are not maintained and bakefile currently is not distributed in this
form.
